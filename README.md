# Movie Ticket Booking Site

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack movie ticket booking site built to demonstrate skills in web development. It allows users to browse movies, view showtimes, book tickets, and includes an admin panel for managing movies and showtimes. The site is designed with a focus on user experience and efficient ticket booking.

## Features

*   Browse movies with details (title, description, poster, etc.)
*   View showtimes for each movie
*   Book tickets with seat selection
*   Admin Panel for managing movies, showtimes, and bookings
*   User authentication and authorization

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Deployment:** (Specify deployment platform, e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
*   **Other Libraries:** (List key libraries like Axios, React Router, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
*   MongoDB installed and running (or a MongoDB Atlas account)
*   Git installed

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd Movie-Ticket-Booking-Site
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both client and server:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ../server
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `server` directories.
    *   Populate the `.env` files with the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings).  Example:

        ```
        # Server .env
        PORT=3001
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/movie-booking
        JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
        ```

        ```
        # Client .env
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev # or yarn dev (for the backend)
    cd ../client
    npm run dev # or yarn dev (for the frontend)
    ```

    The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your client's `.env` file), and the backend at `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in your server's `.env` file).
